# The book directory contains:

* preprocessed page images
* ground truth (incomplete for Hobbes and Zonaras)
* OCR output from ABBYY and Tesseract

The zip file contains a description of the books with links to the scans and provides material specifically chosen for the OCR workshop. More extensive material can be found in the [OCR testset][testset].
