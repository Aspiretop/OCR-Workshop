# Preparations

## Downloading and installing \pocoto{}
* download the binary distribution of \pocoto{}:
[`ocrcorrection.zip`](http://www.cis.lmu.de/ocrworkshop/data/pocoto/ocrcorrection.zip)
* this will download a zipped archive file `ocrcorrection.zip`.
* extract (unzip) this archive to a convenient place somewhere in your
  user directory
* this will create a folder `ocrcorrection`
* in the folder `ocrcorrection/bin`, identify the appropriate
  executable for your operating system:
    * MS Windows: either `ocrcorrection.exe` or `ocrcorrection64.exe`
    * otherwise it is the file `ocrcorrection`
* if you like, you can create a link to the executable of the
  correction tool on your desktop:
    * drag and drop the executable from your file explorer onto your
      desktop
    * use the operation `link from here` if asked what to do with the
      file

## Download the practice data
* download the following zip files:
[`1668-Hobbes-Leviathan.zip`](http://www.cis.lmu.de/ocrworkshop/data/module-data/m11-pocoto-practice/1668-Hobbes-Leviathan.zip) and
[`1841-DieGrenzboten.zip`](http://www.cis.lmu.de/ocrworkshop/data/module-data/m11-pocoto-practice/1841-DieGrenzboten.zip)

* extract (unzip) the archives
* identify the contents of the archives:
    * `abbyy-xml` contains Abbyy XML formatted OCR output
    * `tess-hocr` contains Tesseract hOCR formatted OCR output
    * `tif` contains the image files
    * `gt` contains ground truth
    * `abbyy-txt, tess-txt` contain OCR output in pure text format (no annotations)

## Starting \pocoto{}
* before you start the application, make sure that the
  [Java Runtime Environment](http://www.java.com) (jre) is installed
  on your system
* to start the application, just double click on either the executable
  or on the link on your desktop
* \pocoto{}'s splash screen should open and after a while, \pocoto{}'s
 main GUI will be seen
 
# Working with \pocoto{}

## Creating a new project

* \pocoto{} is described in detail in the [manual][manual] 
which may be consulted for any questions

* First we will create a project using Abbyy XML data
* Click to `file -> new project` to open the project wizard
    * project name field: e.g. `grenzboten-abbyy`
    * project path: navigate to the directory of your XML data
    * note the 3 created files and look up their meaning in the manual
* Click `next`:
    * `OCR Input`: choose the directory containing the abbyy-xml files
    * `Input type`: in this case, ABBYY XML
    * `Encoding`: this should normally be set to UTF-8
* Click `next`:
    * `Img Dir`: choose the directory containing the tif files


## Creating a new project (cont'd)

* Click `finish`
* now your directory structure should look like the image below!

## Page navigation and error correction
* Try to find an OCR error on any page but the first.
* Try to correct the OCR error.
* What is the most common error in the project?
* How can you examine the most common errors?
* How can you fix all those errors at once?
* After you have fixed all these errors, how do you save your work?

## Creating another project using hOCR data

\colA{8.5cm}

* Let's create another project using the hOCR files.
* Which directory should you choose for `OCR Input`?
* What kind of `Input type` should you select?
* What directory should you choose for `Img Dir`?
* Your directory structure should look like the image.

\colEnd

## Comparing two projects
* What is the striking difference between the Abbyy Project and the hOCR
  Project?
* Try to find an OCR error on any page but the first.
* Try to correct the OCR error.
* Ok, now lets switch back to the Abbyy Project:
    * goto `file -> recent project`
    * select the project name of your Abbyy project

## Ordering a document profile
* Try to order a document profile for the document's language:
    * Click to `profiler -> order document profile`.
    * In the window that opens up select the language of your
      document.
    * Click `Ok` and start the profiling.
* After the profiler has finished, what is the most common *error
  pattern* \
  (e.g., `n -> u`)
* How do you correct this error pattern?

## Measuring your correction effort

* let's compare the error rate of your pages before and after correction
* before correction (with provided text files):
```bash
for i in gt/*.gt.txt; do j=`basename $i`; 
    echo $j; ocrevalutf8 accuracy $i tess-txt/"${j/.gt.txt/.tess.txt}" 
    > tess-txt/"${j/.gt.txt/.acc}"; done
```
* build a summary report:
```bash
    cd tess-txt
    accsum *.acc > accum
    more accsum
```
* now export your project (`File -> Export -> as plain text, one file per page`) to a new directory (e.g., `tess-corr`) and apply the same procedure as above
* how many errors have been fixed?

* exporting your project as text files *before* correction, you can get the baseline (this is already provided as separate OCR output)

## Books and sources

* for further experimentation, some [book excerpts][books] (ca. 100 pages each)
can be found in the data directory of this workshop
    * preprocessed page images
    * ground truth (incomplete for Hobbes and Zonaras)
    * OCR output from ABBYY and Tesseract

* sources for the scans of complete volumes are given below

* many thanks to Kay WÃ¼rzner (Grenzboten), Federico Boschetti (Zonaras)
and Haide Friedrich-Salgado (Hobbes) for providing us with ground truth

* Goethe: [Wahlverwandtschaften][wahlverw], vol. 1, 1809
    * [Text][text] in Deutsches Textarchiv

* [Die Grenzboten][grenzboten], 1841

* Hobbes: [Leviathan][leviathan], Latin edition, 1668

* Zonaras: [Epitome historiarum][epitome], 1870
